This is a Simple Quiz on JavaScript using html,css,javascript.
A simple html form is used to display the questions and the form calls a Javascript function on Submission.

The form uses the name attribute as a reference for the questions(q1/q2/q3/q4)and value attribute holds the option selected by the user (a/b/c/d).
The Javascript uses document.forms to access the value selected by the user, futher checks for validation(whether all the questions are attempted), the answers are checked and the results are displayed using the innerHTML property.
